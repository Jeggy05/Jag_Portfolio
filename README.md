# Jag-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio which is more like single page app online resume.

## Purpose of this Project
The main purpose to pick up this project is to improve my front-end development skills. First, I get a course on front-end development and practice my html, CSS and Javascript skills from there. Then, this project comes to my mind and here we goo!

## Tech/Framework used
This app is created using Vue js framework. I have also used following modules in this project:
  1. VueGapi - This is vue js plugin for Google API
  2. GoogleFonts - For font styles
  3. FontAwesome - For icons/emojis
  4. Bootstrap

## Features
This is not a normal front-end app. I have implemented some difference functionality to make it more interesting front-end app. Refer below
  * Experience and skills can be instantly updated via JSON file as no hard coding is done
  * Reference can be contacted via email directly from the single page app via Gmail.
  * Added some motions when scrolling up and down on certain sections such as Education and Skills

## Upcoming changes (_This section will be updated again in next build_)
Considering to perform some changes on the existing project
  1. Move reference section to JSON file so that user (myself) can immediately update reference in the future
  2. Try to support more than 3 reference on reference section
  3. Change the Experience section UI/UX design to make more attractive
  4. Use Google API to support my personal email so that recruiters can reach me via their gmail.
